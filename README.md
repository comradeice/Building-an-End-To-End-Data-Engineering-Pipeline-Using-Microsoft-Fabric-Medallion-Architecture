# Building an End-To-End Data Engineering Pipeline Using Microsoft Fabric Medallion Architecture

## Project Overview
We will explore how to build an end-to-end data engineering pipeline using Microsoft Fabric’s Medallion Architecture.
We will also show how to use a semantic model to create Power BI report for global earthquake events. 

Ingesting Earthquake events data from [usgs]https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/. 

Technologies Used: Python, PySpark, Fabric (Lakehouse, Data Factory, Power BI)

## Getting Started
We created a Fabric Workspace named “USGS Global Earthquake Data Engineering Project”, and a Lakehouse named “Earthquake Lakehouse” as shown in the attached code snippets. 


## Prerequisites
- Microsoft Fabric Account.
- Basic Power BI skills.
- Fabric Administrator (or access to individual with Admin account).
- Familiarity with Python, Spark, and basic data engineering concepts.
